Fork of the original spextractor (<https://github.com/astrobarn/spextractor>).

**spextractor** is a Python package designed to extract line velocities and
pseudo-equivalent widths (pEWs) from astronomical spectra using Gaussian
process regression. While originally tailored for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),
this code is adaptable to other spectral types and features.

---

## Features

- **Gaussian Process Smoothing**: Applies GPR to model spectral data, providing smooth interpolations and uncertainty estimates.
- **Feature Extraction**: Calculates velocities and pEWs for specified spectral features.
- **Uncertainty Estimation**: Offers statistical error estimates for measurements, with recent updates replacing deprecated methods with more robust alternatives.
- **Extensibility**: Easily adaptable to different spectral features and types beyond SNe Ia.
