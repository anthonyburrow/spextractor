# spextractor

Fork of the original spextractor (<https://github.com/astrobarn/spextractor>).

This code uses Gaussian processes to extract line velocities and pseudo-equivalent
widths (along with RSi, etc.) of a given spectrum. Designed for Type Ia's, however
mostly generalized for any given feature (see code). See example for use.

# Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/anthonyburrow/spextractor.git
cd spextractor
pip install .
```
